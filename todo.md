Game idea:
you are on a mining spaceship and an alien sneaks on. your legs are either broken or consumed by the alien.
You crawl and lock yourself in the computer room. The alien destroys engines and SOME power.

Inside the computer room you have acess to a computer which can get acess to the following:
- look at cameras around the ship.
- control rover.

You must use the rover and cameras to complete the game

Game objectives:
1. fix power--opens locked doors etc, allows for other objectives once complete
	1. Restore engines. 
		1. Disable gravity 
			1. float to nav room and go home (win.)	
2. find way to get rid of alien (optional.)


To do these objectives you will need use the rover and cameras to explore while remaining hidden from the alien.
There will be interaction puzzles for the robot(controller) and stuff to do on the computer(hands).
